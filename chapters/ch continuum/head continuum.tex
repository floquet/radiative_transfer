\chapter{\label{ch:continuum formulation}Continuum formulation}

The modeling of complicated atomic processes is handled by the computer code HELIOS at LANL which outputs two tables: one for emissivity, the other opacity. The user selects a range of temperatures and pressures and the code creates a table of output values. Given this rich source of information, we are able to model the functions $\alpha(T,\rho)$ and $j(T,\rho)$ as two dimensional surface. Such a continuum formulation allows us to use powerful analytic tools.
