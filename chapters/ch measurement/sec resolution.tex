\section{\label{sec:measurement:resolution}Resolution}

We have established that the linear system used to solve for the scalar field $\psi(r)$ inside the capsule has a unique solution and we have quantified the conditioning and the asymptotic behavior. Now we turn our attention to measurements made by instruments within our technological scope.

As such the question is how well can we resolve the spatial structure of the function $\psi$ with, say, 25 zones?

Begin with the simple intuition of an example. Figure \eqref{fig:scalar profile} shows a sample profile for $\psi(r)$. The profile has enough structure to be of interest. The number of crests and troughs is easily discernible and there is a very abrupt change in the function near the boundary $r = 1$. This profile is rendered in circular cross sections at different resolutions in table \eqref{tab:measurement:zones}.
