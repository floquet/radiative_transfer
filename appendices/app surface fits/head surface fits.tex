\chapter{Surface fits}

In \S \eqref{sec:continuum formulation}, we described the HELIOS data tables as a continuous surface to explore the radiative transfer problem analytically. A sample surface fit for the opacity for the He $\beta$ line shown in figure \eqref{tab:HELIOS tables I}, $(a)$. 

\begin{equation}
  \begin{split}
    \Gamma \paren{ T, \rho } 
      & \approx a_{0,0} + a_{1,0} T + a_{0,1} \rho + a_{2,0} T^{2} + a_{1,1} T \rho + a_{0,2} \rho^{2} \dots a_{0,10} \rho^{15}  \\
      & = \sum_{j=0}^{15}{ \sum_{k=0}^{j}{ a_{j-k,k}T^{j-k}\rho^{k} } }
  \end{split}
\end{equation}

A sample surface fit is also shown in the main body. This appendix shows the results for the other three fits.
