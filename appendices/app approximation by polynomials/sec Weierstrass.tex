\section{Weierstrass theorem}
This polynomial set has typical properties for an orthogonal set. However some ambiguity has appeared as some authors have introduced different naming conventions; we adhere to Zernike's protocol which is based upon the Euler identity.

\begin{myTheorem}
The space of polynomials is dense in $[0,1]$ with respect to the uniform norm.
\label{thm:Weierstrass}
\end{myTheorem}

\begin{proof}
Try not to embarrass myself.
\end{proof}

\begin{proof}
The proof by Siegel\cite{Siegel:1972} weakens the conditions.
